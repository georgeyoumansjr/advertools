But when budgets get tight, they\u2019ll flock to the businesses they know will deliver the most value. How, then, can you ensure that you\u2019re attracting as many repeat customers as possible? For Casey\u2019s General Stores, the answer is simple: Give customers more of what they want, when they want it. Casey\u2019s, the third largest convenience chain in the U.S., engages millions of customers each year with fast and friendly service across more than 2,400 stores. But to retain loyal customers, the company needed to deliver exceptional experiences outside of the store, too. As customers demanded more convenient and personalized digital experiences, Casey\u2019s shifted its digital strategy by: Delivering more relevant offers and promotions based on purchase history Providing more convenient ordering options Giving customers more personalized rewards for their loyalty Leading the charge toward a more customer-centric Casey\u2019s, Art Sebastian, Vice President of Digital Experience, used Salesforce to bring this vision to life. In just a few years, Sebastian and his team were able to turn data from billions of customer interactions into hyperpersonalized experiences that kept customers coming back. For instance, with real time data activation, Casey\u2019s can create personalized email segments 30 times faster than before. Plus, API-led integration lets the company meet customer needs and introduce new services four times faster \u2014 among other remarkable results. \u201cConsumers are changing how they shop, how they decide to spend their time, and the role of technology in their lives,\u201d Sebastian said. \u201cSo we decided to modernize our brand, and our digital experience would be the first expression of a more contemporary Casey\u2019s.\u201d Here\u2019s an inside look at how Casey\u2019s uses  Salesforce Customer 360  to build customer loyalty through more efficient marketing practices. \n                \n                    Table of Contents \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             \n                \n                    \u201cAs marketers, our number one job is to build and deepen relationships with our customers.

Boost conversion rates by 16% with relevant messaging. \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             Before Casey\u2019s began its digital transformation, its marketing department was sending customers over 300,000 batch and blast emails per month. With no personalization or optimized send schedules, many of these messages were falling flat. Today, Casey\u2019s sends approximately 170 million personalized messages across channels, including email, SMS, and app, with  Marketing Cloud \u00a0and  Data Cloud \u00a0\u2014 implemented with the help of\u00a0Salesforce consulting partner\u00a0 Deloitte Digital . \u201cPart of the journey of modernizing our brand involves ensuring that we form a human connection with every customer,\u201d said Sebastian. \u201cWe call our customers by name in emails, add their favorite store in messages to make ordering even easier, and we even celebrate their birthdays with a free donut.\u201d To create these personalized journeys, Casey\u2019s segments customer data into unique groups based on online and in-store interactions and activates that data in real time. For example, the company can tailor offers based on the type and quantity of goods bought.

Make every touchpoint count with the help of AI. \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             Content was only part of the messaging puzzle the company needed to solve. Timing was just as important. Using  Data Cloud , Casey\u2019s can activate audience segments with  AI  and send messages when customers are most likely to act on them. \u201cEverything we know about a customer is unified in Data Cloud,\u201d said Sebastian. \u201cIf we see groups of customers shopping in the mornings, we can tag them as \u2018breakfast shoppers,\u2019 making it very easy for marketers to create segments and communicate a value proposition.\u201d Instead of sending mass promotional content at random times, Casey\u2019s can adapt send times to customer behavior. For example, if a customer who normally orders pizza around 6:00 p.m. on a Friday doesn\u2019t, Casey\u2019s can send a reminder with a promo code through the customer\u2019s app that same evening. The company can also optimize its website content based on time of day. Customers browsing the homepage in the morning will see breakfast specials, while evening visitors will see the latest deals for whole pizzas or sweet treats. Additionally, Casey\u2019s continues to fine-tune its behavior-based marketing with expert coaching sessions, like \u201cHelp Setting Up Social Studio\u201d and \u201cCDP Mobile/Web Technical Guidance,\u201d from its  Premier Success Plan . With tailored guidance from Salesforce experts, the company can learn from habits across channels and deliver increasingly personalized customer experiences. \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             \n              \n                Get instant insights with Einstein Intelligence\n               \n              \n             \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             \n              \n                Drive results with Premier Success\n               \n              \n             \n                \n                    \u201cOur customers have told us that they\u2019re happy for us to know them better if we use that information to make every interaction more relevant.\u201d \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             \n                \n                    Step 3. Serve customers four times faster by connecting data across the business. \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             Ten years ago, most customers discovered new convenience stores by walking through the front door. Today, that front door is digital. \nTo make it easier for customers to begin their journeys online, Casey\u2019s had to connect data across multiple disparate systems and third-party apps. The company now uses  MuleSoft \u00a0as\u00a0its API-led integration layer between data sources. Now, authorized users see a full view of customer accounts, including past purchases, rewards history, and customer service requests, on a single screen.

Get a customer relationship management system that scales and supports growth. \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             As the company grew and doubled in size every few years, Torani found its legacy systems couldn\u2019t keep up. Sticky notes and spreadsheets limited communication across teams and regions. And because Torani has many sales team members working independently across different regions, it was difficult for the team to collaborate and share information. \n \nThe nationally dispersed sales organization, coupled with siloed data, prevented Torani from having a comprehensive understanding of its teams and its customers. Given the company\u2019s people-centric culture and deeply rooted values, the inability to share information became a problem. That\u2019s when Torani pivoted to using Salesforce. Torani started with  Sales Cloud  to oversee opportunity management, pipeline management, reports and dashboards. Soon after, they integrated Salesforce into Outlook to manage contacts, and eventually added Chatter to cover internal correspondence. Salesforce has enabled Torani to manage all of its deals with 25 sales team members.  \u201c Our focus on people and amazing flavor has let us scale at a tremendous pace for nearly 100 years.\u201d  |\n            \n                General Manager, International Business, Torani \n            \n         \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             \n              \n                Manage your information and grow at scale with Opportunity Management\n               \n              \n             \n                \n                    2.

Focus your team on a single source of truth. \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             Although ICS+ had been using both enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM) tools, most of its project management and custom billing was handled manually or in spreadsheets. Having information spread across so many platforms made it difficult for the ICS+ team to have a complete view of project status across its client base. In turn, keeping up with so many moving pieces became a drain on employee productivity across sales, project management, and accounting. Plus, the cost of subscribing to multiple business technology products was adding up. ICS+ left its hodgepodge collection of business technologies behind, moving to a streamlined solution centered around Salesforce and Salesforce Anywhere. Straightaway, Salesforce gave ICS+ a sole repository for client and project information, easily accessible to anyone on the team who needed it. Thanks to more timely and accurate project management data within Salesforce, ICS+ can invoice and collect from customers faster, shortening its accounts receivables cycle by 15 days. \n                \n                     2. Maximize collaboration and productivity. \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             Before Salesforce, ICS+ employee collaboration and information-sharing on projects took place largely through email. Between client communications and internal collaboration, employee inboxes were in a constant state of overflow. Enter Salesforce Anywhere, Salesforce\u2019s collaborative productivity platform. ICS+ adopted Salesforce Anywhere internally and provided clients with access to relevant documents on the platform.The built-in, real-time communications features helped reduce company email traffic by an average of 20%, while capturing precise details within one system of record. \u200b\u200b\u201cOur productivity has skyrocketed with Salesforce since we can communicate with Chatter and collaborate on Salesforce Anywhere,\u201d said Bernard Morgan, CEO and President. He cited his team\u2019s ability to work faster as the primary reason for the whopping 942% return on investment that ICS+ has seen on Salesforce to date. \u201c Understanding what the client likes and dislikes helps us know what to do. Salesforce helps us put all of that information together so we can act on it.\u201d  |\n            \n                CEO and President, ICS+ \n            \n         \n                \n                    3.

Tracking opportunities within Salesforce helps ICS+ be more selective about the opportunities it wants to pursue and to close more deals. Faster access to working capital, increased sales, and a near-tenfold ROI? Sounds like a big win for this forward-thinking small business. \u201c Salesforce has a place for us to put all of those details. Employees can make decisions on their own because of Salesforce.\u201d  |\n            \n                VP & Co-founder, ICS+ \n            \n         \n                \n                    More

Y\u2019vonne started a consulting company driven by values and customer experience, not industry-standard KPIs like utilization and billable hours. Y\u2019vonne had another reason she wanted to start 5P. Two, actually: her kids. Define your purpose. Put your clients first. Give your company\u2019s teams a central place to communicate. Add tools to support a growing business. Enjoy the journey. \n                \n                    1. Define your purpose. \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             \u201cIt was a pivotal moment in my life,\u201d said Y\u2019vonne Ormond, Founder and CEO of 5P Consulting. \u201cI had decided to leave the corporate environment to create something bigger than just me,\u201d she said. \u201cI had children I wanted to have dinner with each night instead of being away at work or traveling.\u201d Y\u2019vonne also wanted to let her employees work from anywhere so they too could be with their families more. At its center Y\u2019vonne\u2019s vision for 5P Consulting was holistic and purpose-driven. The new business was founded with a focus on measurable return on investment for clients, and a stated mission to give back to the community. When it came time to name the business, Y\u2019vonne asked, \u201cWhat are the triggers that we focus on with our engagements?\u201d The answer was the five \u201cPs:\u201d people, process, products, profit and loss, and priorities. Those principles guide the company's work today, as it helps client organizations improve productivity by building and improving upon business systems to leverage employee strengths and technology best practices. Most of 5P\u2019s clients are enterprise-size companies, spread across various industries but bound by a shared desire to enact digital and process transformations on their business systems. \n                \n                    2. Put your clients first. \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             By focusing on client success, 5P is able to thrive in the huge and competitive management consulting industry. \u201cWe come in and understand what the current business problem and ongoing strategic need is first,\u201d Y\u2019vonne said. \u201cWe come up with actionable solutions to improve how they operate, and then we enable the solutions with technology.\u201d 5P offers complete tech stack and roadmap evaluations, as well as implementation and integration of enterprise resource planning (ERP) and  customer relationship management  (CRM) systems. Another characteristic that differentiates 5P in the consulting world is that it doesn\u2019t have a sales team. Each of 5P\u2019s team members has a business and technical delivery background; the 5P consultant who meets the client during pre-sales conversations stays involved with the project from beginning to end. Y\u2019vonne said this creates a culture of partnership with clients all the way through the customer lifecycle. \u201c We provide transparency to our clients, so they never have to guess where their project is or where their money has been spent.\u201d  |\n            \n                Founder & CEO, 5P Consulting \n            \n         \n                \n                    3. Give your company\u2019s teams a central place to communicate. \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             This approach to consulting has paid dividends for 5P\u2019s clients and employees alike, but has required that the company find a new way of running its business. Even though it\u2019s a small business, the 5P team found itself dealing with information silos as the practice grew. Though quite familiar with CRM, 5P hadn\u2019t invested in a system because Y\u2019vonne couldn\u2019t find a solution that fit her small team\u2019s price point and needs. Employees lived in their inboxes \u2014 as many small businesses and service organizations do \u2014 without any way to share real-time status updates on sales meetings, project progress, and client communications. They were bound by email and manual file sharing. This proved especially challenging when the team was focused on winning new clients, since there was little visibility into individual team members\u2019 activities and progress. Then, in 2017, Salesforce launched  Salesforce Essentials , its first product built just for small businesses. It was just what 5P needed. Essentials included the same functionality 5P consultants knew from client work using Sales Cloud and Service Cloud Enterprise Edition. Now they could use it internally. \u201c I was ecstatic when Salesforce Essentials launched. Here was the Salesforce we knew and loved, but built for small business needs.\u201d  |\n            \n                Founder & CEO, 5P Consulting \n            \n         \n                \n                    4. Add tools to support a growing business. \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             With Salesforce Essentials, 5P\u2019s leadership team tracks all consulting engagements in a central location. Every member of the team shares notes on conversations with prospects and clients, and tools like Lightning for Gmail and Files Connect make it fast and easy to sync external docs to Salesforce, without having to switch apps or even screens. With so much of its business handled over email, 5P also benefits from Salesforce Inbox, which uses Einstein Activity Capture to automatically log emails and meetings to their respective account records. 5P recently started integrating DocuSign as well, and plans to fold in project management tools, time tracking, and financials this year. This has all led to measurable results: To date, 5P has realized a 50% overall time savings from Einstein Activity Capture alone. A surprising bonus? Y\u2019vonne is able to lead by example, showing the rest of 5P how many prospects she engages with on a daily basis. Visibility into her work encourages healthy competition among team members, which helps propel the business through slower months. \n                \n                    5. Enjoy the journey. \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             Having worked with many businesses over the years, and founded one other company before 5P Consulting, Y\u2019vonne knows what it takes to found and grow a company. Her advice to prospective small business leaders? Don\u2019t give up. \u201cNot every activity in your business needs to have an outcome,\u201d she said. \u201cJust enjoy the process and appreciate that it's going to take a little bit of time.\u201d That said, anything a small business can do to save itself time is worth its weight in gold. For 5P Consulting, Salesforce Essentials is the answer. Instead of writing emails and holding one-on-one meetings, Essentials provides companywide visibility into client meetings, project status, and other vital business information.  \u201cSalesforce Essentials really cuts down how we manage our sales cycle. We're not spending a lot of time asking each other what's going on, because we can see it all in Essentials,\u201d Y\u2019vonne said. \u201c One of the most important traits you need to have when you're starting a business is perseverance.\u201d  |\n            \n                Founder & CEO, 5P Consulting \n            \n         \n                \n                    More Resources \n

Cheaper. Easier. Better. Salesforce takes your business to the next level. Salesforce's customer relationship management software instantly streamlines and automates your business processes. By creating infrastructure-as-a-service, your business allows sales, marketing, and support teams to work in sync and see important sales and customer data with more width and breadth, freeing them up to generate new clients and better service existing ones. \n                \n                    Why will Salesforce revolutionise your Sales and Marketing? \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             Our effective customer relationship management solutions help keep your sales reps and marketing team focused on filling the sales pipeline and generating revenue - not manually tracking sales leads. By allowing your team to market through multiple channels and view all account-related information and activities, Salesforce Customer Management Software reveals what works and what doesn't - and converts your leads into clients more often, more quickly. Client Relationship Management Solutions for Activity Management. \nBy showcasing customer transactions and important information about your client contacts,  CRM  helps your business respond confidently to customer enquiries and manage follow-up actions more efficiently. Client Relationship Management Solutions for Service & Support. \nCRM enhances your ability to provide an excellent customer experience: allowing you to collate customer support requests from various channels, assign teams and agents more efficiently, access the best solutions to customer problems, boost support cases, direct customers towards web-based solutions and quickly highlight where your service can be improved. CRM solutions offer a plethora of tools and options to help your business shine: partner/channel management, web communities, award-winning interfaces, point-and-click customisation, and seamless CRM integration at Salesforce. \n                \n                    Why choose Web CRM over Traditional CRM Software? \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             The tide of contemporary business culture is turning away from traditional customer relationship management software, which is expensive to install and maintain, and opting for web or hosted relationship management instead. Why pay more to manage leads and create well recorded and successful client interactions when Salesforce uses a pay-as-you-go model that saves you money? Salesforce provides Sales-as-a-Service (SaaS) that excels at  sales tracking, measuring  and organising your business, yet remains enticingly cost effective. Web CRM Pays For Itself More Quickly.  Removing the need for a huge capital investment on IT infrastructure and technical maintenance staff and streamlining existing IT costs with PaaS, our Customer Management Software offers a much quicker return on investment. Web-Based CRM Will Transform Your Business Faster.  Hosted CRM implementations take weeks or months - beating the 12 month average of client/server CRM tools hands down. Hosted CRM Is More User-Friendly.  Salesforce's basic CRM's customisations and point-and-click interface accommodates the non-technical user. On-Demand CRM Provides Unlimited Scalability.  Salesforce software uses a multi-tenant approach - there's no single instance of the software, so it's faster and cheaper to implement. Web CRM Features  Painless Upgrades.  Deployments of new features on our customer management systems are instantaneous, so you are always using the latest version. \n                \n                    What is Cloud Computing? \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             Cloud Computing  is the revolutionary new way to deliver software to businesses in the Third Millennium - over the net. With no software or hardware to buy, install, maintain, or upgrade, the much more compelling cloud computing model is transforming the customer relationship management market into a rental model - permanently.

Trends in Workflow Automation 2021 Report \u201c I saved my admins an average of three hours per week with one automated workflow.\u201d Automation can seem difficult and complex, but it doesn't have to be. Starting with simple task automation, you can save time and effort by automating any predictable actions. For more complex processes, you can create new processes that enhance your customer experiences. Regardless of the use case, you can add value at every level with little to no code. You want to focus on delivering value, improving productivity at work, and providing enhanced customer experiences fast. Here are three ways workflow automation helps: \n                \n                    1. Save Your Team Time by Reducing Manual Tasks \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             \n                \n                    2. Provide Consistent Experiences and Minimize Errors \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             \n                \n                    3. Create New Processes with Intelligent Workflows \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             \n                \n                    1. Reduce Manual Tasks to Save Time \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             What all repetitive tasks have in common is that they have a predictable pattern. Reclaim valuable time for your company and remove the potential for error by automatically taking any follow-up actions with  Salesforce Flow . You can simply start with triggered flows to eliminate those repetitive tasks from your team and allow them to focus on their roles. If you need to check multiple records on a specific date and time, then you can schedule automation to complete large jobs all in one batch. \nWhen your team spends their time on manual tasks, this not only takes them away from their roles, but as these tasks start to pile up they can be easily overlooked. If your sales team has to check if they have new opportunities, this could mean that they aren\u2019t following up with prospects as soon as the opportunity is created. You can automate this to ensure that anytime a new opportunity is created, the correct sales representative is immediately notified via a push notification. Triggered actions automate any follow-up tasks after the trigger event happens. This reduces the time your team spends on manual tasks and ensures that the correct actions take place. \nIf you need to take actions on multiple records at once, batch jobs are ideal for any predictable process that happens at a specific date and time and ultimately minimize errors and delays. \u201c Flow decreased our customer service email response time by 50%.\u201d \n                \n                    2. Provide Consistent Experiences and Minimize Errors \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             Sometimes, decision-making processes can be cumbersome. Teams can choose different routes for what should be the same course of action. This leads to inconsistent business results and customer experiences. By instead using decision logic to automatically choose the correct answer for your teams, you provide a standard experience every time. Now, simple automation processes typically occur without any human interaction like your triggered actions or decision logic. However, complex automation often requires more interaction from both your teams and customers. Often, you find yourself having to collect important information from your teams and customers. This could be your HR team collecting a new hire\u2019s contact information, office location, and laptop preference to send them their laptop. Or your customers contacting a service agent to cancel their order and providing their order number and contact information. When your team is collecting and storing data, this can lead to errors or even delay the process. Instead, you could guide your teams and customers through screens that allow them to input information themselves and ensure the correct actions automatically take place based on their inputs. Your new employee could fill out a form, which ensures the employee\u2019s contact information is stored and sends your IT team a push notification to ship the employee\u2019s laptop. Your customer could access an online form that allows them to cancel their order themselves and enables them to self-serve 24/7. These guided workflows reduce user error, collect better quality data, and provide consistent experiences. \n                \n                    3. Create New Processes with Intelligent Workflows \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             So far we\u2019ve discussed how existing business processes can be automated to increase value. What if the current process is not optimized? By completely rethinking the way your business operates, you can create a better customer experience, ensure your data is integrated across systems, and enable your teams to learn from insights and take immediate action on them. How can your processes be transformed? Let your customers self-serve everyday tasks such as updating billing addresses and automate actions based on their input. Or, effectively handle your data by connecting your web applications to automate actions across these systems. Or, help your sales team provide customers with the best deals by surfacing the correct discount offer based on your customer data. No matter the use case, building intelligent workflows with clicks, not code, will save your company time, reduce user errors, and free people to do meaningful work. \u201c Salesforce Flow gave us

Cheaper. Easier. Better. Salesforce takes your business to the next level. Salesforce's customer relationship management software instantly streamlines and automates your business processes. By creating infrastructure-as-a-service, your business allows sales, marketing, and support teams to work in sync and see important sales and customer data with more width and breadth, freeing them up to generate new clients and better service existing ones. \n                \n                    Why will Salesforce revolutionise your Sales and Marketing? \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             Our effective customer relationship management solutions help keep your sales reps and marketing team focused on filling the sales pipeline and generating revenue - not manually tracking sales leads. By allowing your team to market through multiple channels and view all account-related information and activities, Salesforce Customer Management Software reveals what works and what doesn't - and converts your leads into clients more often, more quickly. Client Relationship Management Solutions for Activity Management. \nBy showcasing customer transactions and important information about your client contacts,  CRM  helps your business respond confidently to customer enquiries and manage follow-up actions more efficiently. Client Relationship Management Solutions for Service & Support. \nCRM enhances your ability to provide an excellent customer experience: allowing you to collate customer support requests from various channels, assign teams and agents more efficiently, access the best solutions to customer problems, boost support cases, direct customers towards web-based solutions and quickly highlight where your service can be improved. CRM solutions offer a plethora of tools and options to help your business shine: partner/channel management, web communities, award-winning interfaces, point-and-click customisation, and seamless CRM integration at Salesforce. \n                \n                    Why choose Web CRM over Traditional CRM Software? \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             The tide of contemporary business culture is turning away from traditional customer relationship management software, which is expensive to install and maintain, and opting for web or hosted relationship management instead. Why pay more to manage leads and create well recorded and successful client interactions when Salesforce uses a pay-as-you-go model that saves you money? Salesforce provides Sales-as-a-Service (SaaS) that excels at  sales tracking, measuring  and organising your business, yet remains enticingly cost effective. Web CRM Pays For Itself More Quickly.  Removing the need for a huge capital investment on IT infrastructure and technical maintenance staff and streamlining existing IT costs with PaaS, our Customer Management Software offers a much quicker return on investment. Web-Based CRM Will Transform Your Business Faster.  Hosted CRM implementations take weeks or months - beating the 12 month average of client/server CRM tools hands down. Hosted CRM Is More User-Friendly.  Salesforce's basic CRM's customisations and point-and-click interface accommodates the non-technical user. On-Demand CRM Provides Unlimited Scalability.  Salesforce software uses a multi-tenant approach - there's no single instance of the software, so it's faster and cheaper to implement. Web CRM Features  Painless Upgrades.  Deployments of new features on our customer management systems are instantaneous, so you are always using the latest version. \n                \n                    What is Cloud Computing? \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             Cloud Computing  is the revolutionary new way to deliver software to businesses in the Third Millennium - over the net. With no software or hardware to buy, install, maintain, or upgrade, the much more compelling cloud computing model is transforming the customer relationship management market into a rental model - permanently.

All your efforts will help you learn how to best reach potential customers and promote your products and services. \u00a0 This guide will help you review your  marketing strategy  and fine-tune your campaigns.

Now you need to attract more targeted, paying customers. Where do you start? Welcome to the world of marketing. Small business marketing entails getting in front of potential users or consumers. It\u2019s important to reach out to these consumers \u2014 your target market \u2014 so you can focus on their specific wants and needs. That\u2019s because  66%  of customers expect companies to understand their unique needs and expectations. To learn more about identifying your customer base, check out the  \u201cIdentify Your Customer\u201d  lesson on Salesforce Trailhead. There are a variety of paid and organic marketing methods you can use to reach people who want and need your service or product. Whether you have a brick-and-mortar location, own a digital-only storefront, or manage a hybrid of the two, you need to ensure people can find you. Here\u2019s what you need to do to get your marketing up to speed and working for your small business. \n                \n                    Small Business Marketing Basics: Tools and Technology \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             \n                \n                    CRM Platform \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             A  customer relationship management (CRM)  system allows you to organize prospective and current consumer data in one place. This information \u2014 plus good record-keeping \u2014 is vital for your organization, especially your sales, marketing, and customer success teams. With a CRM platform, you can discover actionable insights about your users, track interactions with them, and manage  the entire customer journey , which helps you better tailor your marketing campaigns. In the U.S.,  half of small and midsize companies  have a CRM system, and 15% of those CRM systems were implemented within the last year. \n                \n                    Digital Marketing Platforms \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             Generally, this type of software provides your team some combination of features: organization, automation, and tracking various marketing activities. Often,  these platforms can integrate with other tools , such as your CRM platform. There are many types of specialty platforms within digital marketing, including the following: Email marketing platform \u2014 This software allows users to build and design email campaigns. With an email marketing platform, you can store the email addresses you have for leads and customers, create different segments or email lists for various types of consumers, and  send relevant messages  and promotions depending on where prospects are in the purchase funnel. You can also track user behavior and interactions with your emails, such as open and click-through rates, and links clicked. SMS marketing platform \u2014 This service can exist as a stand-alone product or tool that\u2019s integrated into a larger email marketing platform. Marketing via  short message service , or SMS, commonly known as text messaging, is an effective way to reach users; think of how many people use smartphones and always have them on their person. Businesses can use SMS marketing to communicate flash deals, new products, and more to customers who sign up to receive these messages. Social media marketing platform \u2014 Marketers use this software to manage their  social media efforts . It helps them communicate with their audience, grow their follower count and fan base, and set up scheduled messages on social media. They can also learn important details and data, and see metrics about their audience, all of which they can then use to fuel decisions around what and when to post. Additionally,  social media listening tools  enable businesses to track conversations related to their industry and brand on social media so they can engage with users. Influencer marketing platform \u2014 This relatively newer type of platform is designed to help businesses develop  influencer marketing campaigns . Marketers use this software to find micro (niche) and macro (general) social media and video influencers to promote a product, set up campaigns, and track ROI. \n                \n                    Market Research \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             \n                \n                    Google Analytics \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             Google Analytics tracks all kinds of website-visitor data and generates regular reports that help marketers make data-based decisions about the efficacy of their websites. With it, you can view the breakdown in your visitors\u2019 demographics, location, and age \u2014 even the device they use to visit your site. You can also see which content and pages on your website drive the most (or least) page views, the amount of time visitors spend on a page, conversions, and more. Simply put, Google Analytics hosts a ton of data, and SEO specialists can turn that data into actionable insights. Best of all? It\u2019s free! To get started: Create a Google Analytics account. Set up the property you want to record. In this case, it\u2019s your business website. \nAdd the tracking code to your site. Add the tracking code to your site. Once your account is set up and tracking properly, it should take 24 to 48 hours to see data in your Google Analytics account. You\u2019ll have access to a solid overview of information about your website visitors and how your content and pages are performing. From there, you can dive deeper into tracking specific data points and configuring reports. This  tutorial  provides an in-depth walk-through on how to get started. You can also  link Google Analytics to your Salesforce Sales Cloud account  to access more prospect and client information. \n Google Analytics is a necessary tool, as  99% of marketers  will be using their company website as a channel to market to prospects and customers within the next 12 months. \n                \n                    Content Calendar \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             A content calendar is a centralized place where you list your company\u2019s scheduled content. You can include blog posts, YouTube videos,  social media posts  \u2014 any type of  marketing collateral and content  that your company is producing and plans to publish during a particular time period. You can use a shared online calendar or a spreadsheet with tabs for each month in tandem with project management software to keep track of each piece of content. In spreadsheets, you can list each task for each assignment all the way from preproduction to promotion, tag the person who owns that part of the project, and manage each deadline. If you\u2019re planning a blog post for Father\u2019s Day, for example, a sample workflow might look like this on your content calendar. Add the name of the blog post on its target publish date on the company-wide calendar. Add it to your project management software as a project. Within each task, list the individual items \u2014 write blog post, source image, prepare copy for Twitter, and so on \u2014 needed to complete the post, as well as the accompanying due dates. Tag the individuals responsible who will own a part in bringing the blog post to life and sharing it outside of the organization. These people may include the writer, an editor, a graphic designer, an SEO specialist, and a social media marketing manager. Mark off each task as it\u2019s completed or devise a color-coded system for each step in the process. Communicate regularly with team members to make sure the content and its due date stays on track. Don\u2019t be afraid to adjust the process; if you\u2019re running a lean content operation in the beginning, an online calendar with publication dates might be sufficient to get you started. Depending on your industry, there may be some variability in how far out you can schedule content. Aim between one and six months ahead, leaving wiggle room for when content is delayed or postponed. If your industry needs a certain amount of time to plan for a big event, take that into account as well. For example, if you\u2019re an ecommerce store that wants to plan a big Black Friday promotion, you should plan out content months ahead of November. \n                \n                    Getting Ready to Market Your Small Business \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             \n                \n                    Identify Your Value Proposition, Audience, and Goals \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             To effectively market your product, you need to know who it is you\u2019re marketing to and what you want to say to them. Determine your value proposition \u2014 Give potential buyers a compelling reason to purchase from you. Lean into your benefits more than features, and get clear on  how your offer matches their values  and helps them. As you shape your  unique value proposition , collect feedback early and often. Later, you can turn this feedback into content in the form of case studies and testimonials for your website. After all,  66% of business buyers  expect sales reps to develop solutions \u2014 not just pitch products. Define your audience \u2014 Figure out who your ideal customer is. Ask some starting questions. How old are they, how much money do they make, and where do they live? What are their pain points? How will your product or service meet their needs? Be as specific as possible when you define and get to know your target market. Once you have a clearer idea of who you\u2019re marketing to, you can create tailored marketing and  map out your customer journey . Create goals \u2014 You need something to strive for and measure against. By creating aligned, SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-based) goals, you can meaningfully track your progress \u2014 and  course-correct when needed . Track this data and refer back to it as necessary. \n                \n                    Lock Down Your Brand Messaging Framework \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             Your messaging needs to be sticky to help people remember you and entice them to make repeat purchases from your company. While you can dive really deep here, these four frameworks are a good place to start when  creating brand messaging for your business  that resonates with your users. \u00a0 Brand promise \u2014 This statement sets the stage for what your customers can expect from your company. It should be concise and direct, typically no longer than one or two sentences. \u00a0 \u00a0 Positioning statement \u2014 This statement drills into your exact offerings, target audience, and where you fit in the marketplace. Similar to your brand promise, your positioning statement should be short and sweet. For example, \u201cWe do X for Y people and drive Z results.\u201d Having a positioning statement is especially helpful when you shape your internal and external communication guides. \u00a0 \u00a0 Brand mission \u2014 Working off the previous statements and your value proposition, use the brand mission statement to expand on your core beliefs, what you hope to accomplish, and how you plan to accomplish your goals. \u00a0 \u00a0 Brand voice and tone \u2014 Once you know your audience and market, figure out how best to communicate with them. Determine what  voice and tone  will work for both your business and your industry. For instance, can you be playful in your communications, or would that ding your brand? Workshop this and incorporate your brand\u2019s personality \u2014 see what fits. \u00a0 \n                \n                    Create and Launch Your Website \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             \n                \n                    Website \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             Even if you don\u2019t build an ecommerce store, it\u2019s valuable to own a piece of real estate on the web so customers can search for and find you. At a minimum, you can promote your company story, contact information, and store hours. Claim a website domain name \u2014 Shoot for your own business name and a \u201c.com\u201d domain name, if possible. If those options are taken, consider something on the shorter side that\u2019s easy to spell and remember. If \u201c.com\u201d isn\u2019t an option, try to snag \u201c.co\u201d or \u201c.net.\u201d A helpful tip is to set up auto renewal so you don\u2019t run the risk of letting your ownership of the domain lapse. Many domain name companies let you do this when checking out. Secure hosting \u2014 Once you have your domain name, you need to purchase a hosting package so it can live on the web. You can typically purchase a year or longer upfront, and choose to elect upgrades such as a business email address using your domain name, website themes, and more. Design your site \u2014 Once you purchase your domain name and hosting, it\u2019s time to design. You can purchase a template, work on your own design, or outsource this work to a specialist or agency. Keep it mobile-friendly \u2014 most templates will fit mobile devices by default \u2014 and incorporate best practices, such as no harsh font combinations or garish hues. One often-overlooked step is to make your website  ADA compliant , which means it will be accessible for everyone online. You can also tease your official launch by adding a simple \u201cComing Soon\u201d message to your website. \n                \n                    Logo \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             \n                \n                    Content and SEO \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             Developing a  content and SEO strategy  will help your potential customers learn about you, your company offerings, and your industry. Incorporating strong SEO practices \u2014 such as choosing relevant, high-volume keywords, and getting backlinks from quality websites \u2014 will also help your content rank well on the search engine result pages (SERPs). Create a content and publishing strategy \u2014 Before you promote your website, you\u2019ll want to  add mainstay pages  such as \u201cAbout Us,\u201d \u201cServices/Product categories,\u201d \u201cContact,\u201d and more. And take the time to flesh out your copy. For instance, four or five blog posts is a good starting point. This will help build your SEO efforts and keep readers on the page longer by providing them with additional content, rather than having them see one post and bounce off your website. Promote your content \u2014 Once you hit publish, your work isn\u2019t done. Share your content across multiple channels and make sure to create messaging and images specific to the platform to reach more people. Your content and SEO strategy, when executed well, will help you rank higher on SERPs. A  study from SISTRIX  shows that ranking first on the first page of search results earns approximately 29% of users\u2019 clicks. The second result gets 16%, the third earns 11%, and the percentages drop rapidly from there. Long story short, when your website ranks higher in SERPs, more people click on your website. \n                \n                    An Overview of Marketing Channels and Activities  \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             \n                \n                    Readable Content \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             Articles  \u2014 Content that includes original research, facts, and statistics, and may include interviews with \u2014 or be written by \u2014 subject matter experts. Blog posts  \u2014 Similar to, and sometimes used interchangeably with, articles. Blog posts are usually more editorialized and speak directly to a company's products and services. E-books  \u2014 Content that\u2019s longer than articles and blog posts.

Get a customer relationship management system that scales and supports growth. \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             As the company grew and doubled in size every few years, Torani found its legacy systems couldn\u2019t keep up. Sticky notes and spreadsheets limited communication across teams and regions. And because Torani has many sales team members working independently across different regions, it was difficult for the team to collaborate and share information. \n \nThe nationally dispersed sales organization, coupled with siloed data, prevented Torani from having a comprehensive understanding of its teams and its customers. Given the company\u2019s people-centric culture and deeply rooted values, the inability to share information became a problem. That\u2019s when Torani pivoted to using Salesforce. Torani started with  Sales Cloud  to oversee opportunity management, pipeline management, reports and dashboards. Soon after, they integrated Salesforce into Outlook to manage contacts, and eventually added Chatter to cover internal correspondence. Salesforce has enabled Torani to manage all of its deals with 25 sales team members.  \u201c Our focus on people and amazing flavor has let us scale at a tremendous pace for nearly 100 years.\u201d  |\n            \n                General Manager, International Business, Torani \n            \n         \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             \n              \n                Manage your information and grow at scale with Opportunity Management\n               \n              \n             \n                \n                    2.

Torani is excited to continue to grow across all of these segments and also focus on its consumers \u2014 increasing brand engagement, connecting with fans on social media and by showcasing Torani recipes. \n \n\u201cEven if the consumer or the caf\u00e9 operator isn\u2019t buying directly from us, we want to have a relationship with them since they are the ones ultimately enjoying our amazing flavors,\u201d said Ailinh Hoang Kim, Torani\u2019s Director of Retail Marketing. Torani can build relationships directly with its community of consumers by engaging with them in creative ways using marketing automation. Torani uses  Pardot  to create targeted email campaigns that are personalized according to customer type. The seamless flow of information between Sales Cloud and Pardot allows it to target food-service or retail customers \u2014 existing or potentially new customers \u2014 focused on mainly coffee beverages or refreshment drink offerings. Marketing qualified leads (MQLs) are automatically routed to regional sales reps for additional nurturing and follow-up. Thanks to engaging content and relevant messaging, Torani experienced its fastest, most successful product launch in the company\u2019s nearly century-long history. The company smashed its sales target in 18 months \u2014 a full six months earlier than originally planned. And the email campaign generated over 300 MQLs. \u201c It\u2019s all about customer experience. It\u2019s about how Torani loves consumers, and consumers love Torani.\u201d  |\n            \n                Director of Retail Marketing, Torani \n            \n         \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             \n              \n                Engage with customers and create lasting impressions with Marketing Cloud\n               \n              \n             \n                \n                    Your next big marketing idea starts here. \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             \n              \n                get the ebook\n              \n              \n             \n                \n                    4.

Y\u2019vonne started a consulting company driven by values and customer experience, not industry-standard KPIs like utilization and billable hours. Y\u2019vonne had another reason she wanted to start 5P. Two, actually: her kids. Define your purpose. Put your clients first. Give your company\u2019s teams a central place to communicate. Add tools to support a growing business. Enjoy the journey. \n                \n                    1. Define your purpose. \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             \u201cIt was a pivotal moment in my life,\u201d said Y\u2019vonne Ormond, Founder and CEO of 5P Consulting. \u201cI had decided to leave the corporate environment to create something bigger than just me,\u201d she said. \u201cI had children I wanted to have dinner with each night instead of being away at work or traveling.\u201d Y\u2019vonne also wanted to let her employees work from anywhere so they too could be with their families more. At its center Y\u2019vonne\u2019s vision for 5P Consulting was holistic and purpose-driven. The new business was founded with a focus on measurable return on investment for clients, and a stated mission to give back to the community. When it came time to name the business, Y\u2019vonne asked, \u201cWhat are the triggers that we focus on with our engagements?\u201d The answer was the five \u201cPs:\u201d people, process, products, profit and loss, and priorities. Those principles guide the company's work today, as it helps client organizations improve productivity by building and improving upon business systems to leverage employee strengths and technology best practices. Most of 5P\u2019s clients are enterprise-size companies, spread across various industries but bound by a shared desire to enact digital and process transformations on their business systems. \n                \n                    2. Put your clients first. \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             By focusing on client success, 5P is able to thrive in the huge and competitive management consulting industry. \u201cWe come in and understand what the current business problem and ongoing strategic need is first,\u201d Y\u2019vonne said. \u201cWe come up with actionable solutions to improve how they operate, and then we enable the solutions with technology.\u201d 5P offers complete tech stack and roadmap evaluations, as well as implementation and integration of enterprise resource planning (ERP) and  customer relationship management  (CRM) systems. Another characteristic that differentiates 5P in the consulting world is that it doesn\u2019t have a sales team. Each of 5P\u2019s team members has a business and technical delivery background; the 5P consultant who meets the client during pre-sales conversations stays involved with the project from beginning to end. Y\u2019vonne said this creates a culture of partnership with clients all the way through the customer lifecycle. \u201c We provide transparency to our clients, so they never have to guess where their project is or where their money has been spent.\u201d  |\n            \n                Founder & CEO, 5P Consulting \n            \n         \n                \n                    3. Give your company\u2019s teams a central place to communicate. \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             This approach to consulting has paid dividends for 5P\u2019s clients and employees alike, but has required that the company find a new way of running its business. Even though it\u2019s a small business, the 5P team found itself dealing with information silos as the practice grew. Though quite familiar with CRM, 5P hadn\u2019t invested in a system because Y\u2019vonne couldn\u2019t find a solution that fit her small team\u2019s price point and needs. Employees lived in their inboxes \u2014 as many small businesses and service organizations do \u2014 without any way to share real-time status updates on sales meetings, project progress, and client communications. They were bound by email and manual file sharing. This proved especially challenging when the team was focused on winning new clients, since there was little visibility into individual team members\u2019 activities and progress. Then, in 2017, Salesforce launched  Salesforce Essentials , its first product built just for small businesses. It was just what 5P needed. Essentials included the same functionality 5P consultants knew from client work using Sales Cloud and Service Cloud Enterprise Edition. Now they could use it internally. \u201c I was ecstatic when Salesforce Essentials launched. Here was the Salesforce we knew and loved, but built for small business needs.\u201d  |\n            \n                Founder & CEO, 5P Consulting \n            \n         \n                \n                    4. Add tools to support a growing business. \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             With Salesforce Essentials, 5P\u2019s leadership team tracks all consulting engagements in a central location. Every member of the team shares notes on conversations with prospects and clients, and tools like Lightning for Gmail and Files Connect make it fast and easy to sync external docs to Salesforce, without having to switch apps or even screens. With so much of its business handled over email, 5P also benefits from Salesforce Inbox, which uses Einstein Activity Capture to automatically log emails and meetings to their respective account records. 5P recently started integrating DocuSign as well, and plans to fold in project management tools, time tracking, and financials this year. This has all led to measurable results: To date, 5P has realized a 50% overall time savings from Einstein Activity Capture alone. A surprising bonus? Y\u2019vonne is able to lead by example, showing the rest of 5P how many prospects she engages with on a daily basis. Visibility into her work encourages healthy competition among team members, which helps propel the business through slower months. \n                \n                    5. Enjoy the journey. \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             Having worked with many businesses over the years, and founded one other company before 5P Consulting, Y\u2019vonne knows what it takes to found and grow a company. Her advice to prospective small business leaders? Don\u2019t give up. \u201cNot every activity in your business needs to have an outcome,\u201d she said. \u201cJust enjoy the process and appreciate that it's going to take a little bit of time.\u201d That said, anything a small business can do to save itself time is worth its weight in gold. For 5P Consulting, Salesforce Essentials is the answer. Instead of writing emails and holding one-on-one meetings, Essentials provides companywide visibility into client meetings, project status, and other vital business information.  \u201cSalesforce Essentials really cuts down how we manage our sales cycle. We're not spending a lot of time asking each other what's going on, because we can see it all in Essentials,\u201d Y\u2019vonne said. \u201c One of the most important traits you need to have when you're starting a business is perseverance.\u201d  |\n            \n                Founder & CEO, 5P Consulting \n            \n         \n                \n                    More Resources \n

The system routed those leads to the right sales reps for immediate follow-up. Salesforce reports allowed unconverted leads to become discoverable. Outbound sales reps were reassigned to those leads for follow-up.  The team also tapped  Salesforce Inbox  and Einstein Activity Capture to document emails, calls, and other touchpoints with customers to turn them into actionable next steps. Headspace targeted prospects and markets globally, using data from Salesforce to back its decisions. Salesforce helps Smith\u2019s group nurture B2B relationships by making sure no conversations fall through the cracks at any point in the customer lifecycle. \u201c I want to empower everyone to look at Salesforce as their right-hand partner in success.\u201d  |\n            \n                Global Sales Development Manager, Headspace \n            \n         \n                \n                    4.

Along those lines, the Headspace for Work team is exploring how they can extend its enterprise solution and the benefits of mindfulness to as many people around the world as possible. Smith saw firsthand the impact Salesforce had on the business. \u201cI want to empower everyone to look at Salesforce as their right-hand partner in success,\u201d she said.

She\u2019d seen it happen so many times: women being paid less, subjected to inferior workplace conditions, and passed over for promotions offered to their male counterparts. It happened to her colleagues and it happened to her friends. And then it happened to her. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve seen the gap that exists between men and women, you can\u2019t unsee that,\u201d Palmer said. Not one to sit idle, Palmer founded PepTalkHer, a company that soon became a community. \n                \n                    PepTalkHer has more than 60,000 users in its global community \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             \n                \n                    Salesforce Essentials helps PepTalkHer save 8-10 hours per week on email correspondence \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             Meggie Palmer founded PepTalkHer in 2016 The company is dedicated to closing the gender pay gap by coaching women to be more confident in the workplace \n Prioritize customer relationships.

Prioritize customer relationships. \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             Equal parts social mission and startup business, PepTalkHer is all about relationships. While many were carried over from Palmer\u2019s days as a journalist, a need quickly emerged to manage more \u2014 and more complex \u2014 customer relationships. An entrepreneur friend told Palmer about  customer relationship management  (CRM) tools and relayed how glad she was that her own business had started using Salesforce. \u201cHer company has grown into a multimillion-dollar endeavor, and CRM made that process a lot easier,\u201d Palmer said. Before choosing a technology platform, Palmer tried every customer management tool she could find. \u201cIt drove my team insane, because I was like, \u2018Nope, nope, I don\u2019t like this. It\u2019s not easy enough. It\u2019s not intuitive enough. I was really picky.\u201d Team members took their time trying out and discussing tools before landing on Salesforce Essentials. Why Essentials? Lots of reasons. \u00a0 \u201c I wanted to have all of my customers\u2019 information in one place, because I knew that they were key to our growth.\u201d  |\n            \n                Founder & CEO, PepTalkHer \n            \n         \n                \n                    2. Do business where you want, when you want. \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             First and foremost, Palmer uses Essentials for her email, tracking every customer interaction so nothing falls through the cracks. Keeping everything in a central location also makes it easier for anyone on the team to pick up a conversation with any lead or customer, whether today, tomorrow, or some time further down the line. Emailing through Salesforce also lets Palmer and her team reply to messages and share pricing info, partnership decks, and other collateral anytime and anywhere. Essentials makes it easy to reply from her desk or from her phone in the back of a car between meetings. For a small business owner with an endless to-do list, turning commute time into work time is a real advantage. A self-confessed night owl, Palmer also loves the Salesforce Inbox email scheduling feature, which lets her write after-hours emails that don\u2019t go out until business hours the next day. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit awkward getting a 3:00 a.m. email, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she asked with a laugh. With Salesforce Inbox \u2014 which comes free with Essentials \u2014 Palmer and her team can write now and send later, with the tap of a button. \u201c I\u2019m always meeting with people, catching up with people, and attending events late into the evening.\u201d  |\n            \n                Founder & CEO, PepTalkHer \n            \n         \n                \n                    3.

When it comes to keeping financial oversight of the business, the Essentials dashboard features come in handy. Customizable, easy-to-read charts provide a bird\u2019s-eye view of revenue, pipeline, and other key metrics. Time is a precious commodity to any small business, and Essentials\u2019 automation and AI capabilities help make the most of every minute. From tracking leads and projecting revenue to surfacing new opportunities and nudging team members to follow up with customers, Essentials helps PepTalkHer get things done faster. \u201c Salesforce Essentials scales my time, and my ability to respond quickly and efficiently to clients.\u201d  |\n            \n                Founder & CEO, PepTalkHer \n            \n         \n                \n                    4.

But Palmer is convinced that if you\u2019re setting out to make real change, leaping isn\u2019t actually so hard. For her, that change is closing the gender gap.  Taking that leap produced a net for Palmer, and it created a support net for thousands of other women around the world fighting to have their real value recognized. In just a few years, PepTalkHer has already helped thousands of women track workplace wins and develop their negotiation muscles through its coaching methods, corporate events, and mobile app. The company website touts the story of a woman named Charlotte who used the app to help negotiate a whopping $87,000 raise. It all flows from there: Help individuals be bold in negotiations, work toward collective success for all women, and impact everyone\u2019s lives for the better. \u00a0 \u201c We have this belief that if women know their worth and know how to negotiate their worth, everyone will be better off.\u201d  |\n            \n                Founder & CEO, PepTalkHer \n            \n         \n

Here are five steps to make your first one successful and engaging for customers. The first step is to set a goal for your journey.\u00a0 Start with a simple journey that your customers can easily and quickly benefit from. For example: \u201cI want to increase the share of my customers who make a purchase within one month of subscribing.\u201d This could be a welcome journey, a birthday offer, or a reminder to check out your cool new on-demand help center. While it may be tempting to map out every possible journey for your customer, avoid getting caught up in that. It can become overwhelming and may even prevent you from getting anything off the ground. You can always build off your first journey once it is up and running. Next, it\u2019s time to figure out exactly who you need to talk to. Answering a few key questions can help refine your audience: Is my journey intended for a specific demographic of my audience?  Is it most relevant to customers in a certain geographical region?  Is it targeted to an audience that shares a specific area of interest?\u00a0  Be as specific as possible when defining your audience. This will help you build a journey that\u2019s best suited for them and figure out what data to identify and collect in Step 3. Once you\u2019ve defined an audience, identify what data you need and what you have readily available For your first journey, start with the data you already have access to. Then think about what additional data you\u2019ll need to identify the audience you defined in Step 2. Next, think about what behavioral data to collect and use at key decision points throughout your journey. When you set up form fields to collect customer data, keep in mind the types of journeys and personalization you want to create. Over time, this will help you obtain the data needed to build increasingly personalized customer experiences. The type of customer data you have available will dictate the specific channels you\u2019ll be able to use. For example, if you want to include SMS text messages in the journey, you\u2019ll need phone numbers for your target audience. Tips: Identify what data you need now \u2014 and in the future. \u00a0What data will you need to reach your target audience for this first journey? What data will you need for future journeys?  Plan form fields accordingly. \u00a0Use\u00a0 progressive form fields \u00a0to capture the customer data you need to deliver personalized experiences.  Here\u2019s where the real fun starts. Now that you\u2019ve set a goal, defined your audience, and identified the data you\u2019ll be using for the journey, it\u2019s time to tap into that creative energy.\u00a0 First, decide on the channels you\u2019ll use for your journey and begin crafting content, establishing layouts, and choosing imagery for each. As you do this, consider each channel from your customers\u2019 perspectives. How should your messaging and design vary for email as opposed to SMS, push notifications, or in-app messages? If you\u2019re working in\u00a0 Journey Builder , features like drag-and-drop editing and pre-defined journey templates make designing customer journeys simple. Congratulations on creating your first journey! Take a moment to think about the project. Did you accomplish your goal? What worked well? What didn\u2019t work so well? Dive into your data and look for any gaps or shortfalls to improve future journeys. With the first customer journey under your belt, you can start looking for new opportunities to engage customers. Tips: Measure, measure, measure some more.\u00a0 The more information you collect, the more insight you\u2019ll have into what resonates with your audience.  Build on your successes. \u00a0If something in your first journey \u2014 a message, an offer, or a piece of content \u2014 worked especially well, build on it.

For the latest on Data Cloud,\u00a0 go here . Quick take:  Salesforce   President & Chief Product Officer David Schmaier is a software industry pioneer with deep roots in the CRM space. In this article, he shares how customer data platforms have evolved over time and how  Salesforce Data Cloud , a new data platform powering the world\u2019s first real-time CRM, will shape the future. For the last 30 years, I\u2019ve been fortunate to work with amazing teams on the front lines of enterprise software, building products in pursuit of what many call the Holy Grail of CRM.\u00a0 It\u2019s not a chalice imbued with miraculous powers to increase sales \u2014 it\u2019s a hyperscale customer data platform (CDP) that connects every relevant bit of historical and real-time data to create a single, golden record for every customer, providing the ingredients required to drive customer experiences across every channel that genuinely feel like magic.\u00a0 At times attaining this Holy Grail seemed unachievable. Along this journey, many of us on this quest have felt like Indiana Jones, faced with various obstacles and setbacks at the forefront of CRM\u2019s evolution \u2014 though luckily, without the snakes.\u00a0 I remember a marketing class on the first day of graduate business school where the professor asked over and over again, \u2018Who\u2019s the customer?\u2019 This was drilled into my mind \u2014 you need to know who the customer is before you upsell, cross sell, or provide personalized service and tailored marketing campaigns. And, you can\u2019t know your customer if you don\u2019t have all the relevant data and a single source of truth. And, you can\u2019t know your customer if you don\u2019t have all the relevant data and a single source of truth. But if all you have are disconnected bits of data about a customer \u2014 scattered points of light that are required to illuminate their needs and wants \u2014 you really  don\u2019t  know your customer.\u00a0 That\u2019s how it was when I began my career in the CRM industry in the 1990s. In 1994, when I joined Siebel Systems, the CRM industry was still in its infancy, with leading analysts reporting annual worldwide CRM software sales at $50 million in revenue. Companies at the time built their own custom database software for managing contacts, sales leads, or service cases. Data was siloed and APIs and other data management services that made it easier to integrate data weren\u2019t prevalent. There was no single source of customer truth and these home-grown salesforce automation (SFA) and customer service solutions were costly and ineffective. Early pioneering companies like Siebel, and later, larger established software companies like Oracle and SAP, invested in building packaged CRM solutions starting with SFA. Then, they added customer service, marketing, and other business functions and industry-specific solutions. In 1999, a fledgling Salesforce came on the scene with a new technology platform based in the cloud and a subscription business model. It was the beginning of a revolution led by Salesforce that transformed CRM into a $60 billion software industry today. I had worked with Marc Benioff at Oracle in the 1980s, and was impressed by how he and his team were able to create a platform as a service and ecosystem for CRM that far exceeded what was previously considered possible. I was pulled into the Salesforce orbit in 2014 when I co-founded Vlocity, an ISV which built industry-specific clouds for communications, media and entertainment, energy and utilities, insurance, health, and public sector organizations built entirely on the Salesforce platform. And in 2020 Salesforce acquired Vlocity \u2014 and our talented Vlocity team \u2014 and I officially became part of the Salesforce family. Over the last 30 years, advances in processing power, storage capacity, internet connectivity, artificial intelligence, and other technologies propelled the entire software industry forward. Data integration through APIs, data lakes, and other data management systems became less cumbersome. But the customer data problem continued to persist. \n \n\n\n \n\n\n Healthcare Workers Agree Data Security Is Their Responsibility, But Survey Shows Massive Gaps in Practice \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n Salesforce CRM, Data, and AI Innovations Put Patient Relationships at the Heart of Healthcare Operations \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n Salesforce Brings Commerce CRM, Data, and AI Features to Healthcare and Life Science Companies \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n Reimagined Salesforce Education Cloud Helps Institutions Build Lifelong Student Relationships with Unified Data, Automation, and Intelligence \n Today, larger enterprises have an average of  976 different applications  to run their business \u2014\u00a0that\u2019s 976 potential versions of a single customer and 976 records about each and every customer. Instead of a unified, 360-degree view of the customer, you have fragmented glimpses and disconnected, disjointed experiences.\u00a0 For example, when you call your phone company to change your mobile plan, you have to give them your personal information. If you get transferred to another department, you then have to give all the same information \u2014 again. And the rep doesn\u2019t have access to real-time information \u2014 they don\u2019t know that you just tried to change your mobile plan on their website, just paid your bill online, or that seconds ago you activated a new mobile phone. Not to mention that every additional second you remain on the phone costs the company more money and further downgrades their \u201cnet promoter score\u201d that measures customer satisfaction. Companies tend to think \u201cproducts out\u201d rather than \u201ccustomer in\u201d \u2014 and they aren\u2019t putting the customer at the center of everything they do.\u00a0 All of this wastes the customer\u2019s time, increases support costs, and doesn\u2019t elicit customer loyalty. And in this new all-digital world, milliseconds matter more, especially with the petabytes of data generated from our always-on smartphones, connected cars, home security systems, and many other devices. The amount of data created, captured, replicated, and consumed each year is expected to more than double  by 2026 .\u00a0\u00a0 The more digital data you have and the more real time it is, the more predictive and personalized experiences that companies can deliver for customers. In sales, reps can respond to product interest a second after a prospect clicks on a product page on their website. Retailers can sell products that they know are available now with real-time inventory checks. And AI-generated product recommendations based on real-time data can dramatically increase marketing campaign conversion. And all of this increased efficiency lowers costs for the company and dramatically improves and personalizes the customer experience. A great example of where milliseconds matter is healthcare. With real-time data, a company can create a unified health score for patients complete with data like blood pressure, temperature, and demographic and environmental information.\u00a0 Imagine there\u2019s a patient with asthma. And in that patient\u2019s area, the air quality is getting worse. Using real-time data, our platform can trigger an alert that automatically texts or calls the customer to check in on them, and let them know they\u2019re at risk. A close friend of mine recently had a heart issue that was first detected on his Apple watch. In healthcare, lives matter. And that\u2019s why milliseconds matter. Thanks to technology advances in the last few years and the incredibly talented engineering team at Salesforce, those real-time scenarios are no longer science fiction. The quest \u2014 and that of the entire generation of fellow travelers \u2014 has finally been realized with  Salesforce Data Cloud , a hyperscale customer data platform that powers the world\u2019s first real-time CRM.\u00a0 Data Cloud delivers a single, golden record that captures everything about a customer in real time across every interaction.\u00a0 Open Image Modal Salesforce started this work a few years ago with a customer data platform (CDP) primarily designed for use with our Marketing Cloud. It\u2019s been our fastest growing organically-built product ever, with over 500 customers today. CDP brings together our existing transactional database with historical data and the ability to process hyperscale data in real time, harmonizing data streams from any source and system\u00a0to create a unified customer profile, or customer graph, for marketers.\u00a0\u00a0 CDP is built on a new real-time hyperscale data platform that serves as the foundation for Data Cloud. We say Data Cloud powers the first real-time CRM because Data Cloud now goes beyond marketing, extending the power of our hyperscale data platform across the entire Customer 360.\u00a0 We\u2019ve linked this lake house architecture to Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Commerce Cloud, Slack, Tableau, Mulesoft, and our 13 industry clouds. Data Cloud is the new data infrastructure for the Salesforce platform, with a canonical metadata model to map all systems containing data into one \u2014 meaning data stored in Data Cloud is visible and available to be used in every app built on Salesforce.\u00a0 And because Data Cloud eliminates the need to manually stand up and maintain costly data infrastructure, it reduces both capex and opex expenditures. Ford Motor Company is a great example of how Data Cloud can power connected customer experiences \u2014 from purchase to accessories, onboarding, and maintenance.\u00a0 Customers can receive real-time status updates and insights based on real-time data. The real-time capabilities completely change how customers will interact with companies. In the connected car future, when something malfunctions, instead of the standard check engine light coming on, the car sends a signal to the service center and a technician can reach out to you immediately to let you know the problem exists, troubleshoot the issue, and tell you what next steps to take. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t See product overview \n\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\t\t\t \n\t\t We\u2019ve also made Data Cloud open and extensible, making it easy to get at data outside of Salesforce. For example, zero copy,  real-time data sharing between Salesforce and Snowflake  lets Data Cloud directly access real-time data stored in Snowflake, avoiding the costly and time consuming process of duplicating that data. Customers can manage the security, compliance, governance, and other controls even with the data in Snowflake\u2019s data warehouse.\u00a0 \u2018Bring your own AI\u2019 with Amazon SageMaker  lets companies use Amazon\u2019s machine learning platform to build new AI models alongside our Einstein AI and use them in real time across the Customer 360. While Salesforce\u2019s Einstein now delivers 175 billion predictions a day (up 66% year over year), this open capability allows organizations\u2019 data science teams to use the AI engine of their choice and mix and match them as appropriate. For example, a healthcare company that uses Salesforce Einstein to power AI insights and recommendations to streamline the member journey also relies on applications for clinical trials. Maybe the clinical trials team is more accustomed to using Sagemaker on their applications outside of Salesforce. The SageMaker integration enables the company to use custom AI models that leverage real-time customer data from Salesforce and clinical trial research information together. Open Image Modal What\u2019s especially unique and powerful about Data Cloud is that it makes every part of Salesforce Customer 360 more automated, intelligent, and real time. Data in the customer profiles can easily trigger actions in Flow automation, Einstein AI, and other parts of the Salesforce Platform, personalizing experiences for every customer based on real-time customer data. All of this adds up to decreased costs, increased productivity, and higher customer satisfaction, which are even more important as customers look to drive  success now  in this uncertain economic environment. And Data Cloud runs on  Hyperforce , our public cloud infrastructure. With Hyperforce the data controls are built in \u2014 data residency, security, privacy, and regulatory compliance controls.\u00a0 It\u2019s been an amazing journey over the past three decades working on solving the data problem and building a platform that can help organizations deliver what we call \u201cmagical customer experiences.\u201d With Data Cloud, the Holy Grail of CRM is finally in our grasp. Put another way, with the power of data science, machine learning, and real-time data integration, we can now create seamless, connected, and hyper-personalized customer experiences that weren\u2019t possible before.\u00a0 But this is not the end of the journey. We are at the beginning of a new quest to help our customers harness the power of Genie and deliver their own customer magic. Answer the question:  What is Salesforce Data Cloud?

She\u2019d seen it happen so many times: women being paid less, subjected to inferior workplace conditions, and passed over for promotions offered to their male counterparts. It happened to her colleagues and it happened to her friends. And then it happened to her. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve seen the gap that exists between men and women, you can\u2019t unsee that,\u201d Palmer said. Not one to sit idle, Palmer founded PepTalkHer, a company that soon became a community. \n                \n                    PepTalkHer has more than 60,000 users in its global community \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             \n                \n                    Salesforce Essentials helps PepTalkHer save 8-10 hours per week on email correspondence \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             Meggie Palmer founded PepTalkHer in 2016 The company is dedicated to closing the gender pay gap by coaching women to be more confident in the workplace \n Prioritize customer relationships.

Prioritize customer relationships. \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             Equal parts social mission and startup business, PepTalkHer is all about relationships. While many were carried over from Palmer\u2019s days as a journalist, a need quickly emerged to manage more \u2014 and more complex \u2014 customer relationships. An entrepreneur friend told Palmer about  customer relationship management  (CRM) tools and relayed how glad she was that her own business had started using Salesforce. \u201cHer company has grown into a multimillion-dollar endeavor, and CRM made that process a lot easier,\u201d Palmer said. Before choosing a technology platform, Palmer tried every customer management tool she could find. \u201cIt drove my team insane, because I was like, \u2018Nope, nope, I don\u2019t like this. It\u2019s not easy enough. It\u2019s not intuitive enough. I was really picky.\u201d Team members took their time trying out and discussing tools before landing on Salesforce Essentials. Why Essentials? Lots of reasons. \u00a0 \u201c I wanted to have all of my customers\u2019 information in one place, because I knew that they were key to our growth.\u201d  |\n            \n                Founder & CEO, PepTalkHer \n            \n         \n                \n                    2. Do business where you want, when you want. \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             First and foremost, Palmer uses Essentials for her email, tracking every customer interaction so nothing falls through the cracks. Keeping everything in a central location also makes it easier for anyone on the team to pick up a conversation with any lead or customer, whether today, tomorrow, or some time further down the line. Emailing through Salesforce also lets Palmer and her team reply to messages and share pricing info, partnership decks, and other collateral anytime and anywhere. Essentials makes it easy to reply from her desk or from her phone in the back of a car between meetings. For a small business owner with an endless to-do list, turning commute time into work time is a real advantage. A self-confessed night owl, Palmer also loves the Salesforce Inbox email scheduling feature, which lets her write after-hours emails that don\u2019t go out until business hours the next day. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit awkward getting a 3:00 a.m. email, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she asked with a laugh. With Salesforce Inbox \u2014 which comes free with Essentials \u2014 Palmer and her team can write now and send later, with the tap of a button. \u201c I\u2019m always meeting with people, catching up with people, and attending events late into the evening.\u201d  |\n            \n                Founder & CEO, PepTalkHer \n            \n         \n                \n                    3.

When it comes to keeping financial oversight of the business, the Essentials dashboard features come in handy. Customizable, easy-to-read charts provide a bird\u2019s-eye view of revenue, pipeline, and other key metrics. Time is a precious commodity to any small business, and Essentials\u2019 automation and AI capabilities help make the most of every minute. From tracking leads and projecting revenue to surfacing new opportunities and nudging team members to follow up with customers, Essentials helps PepTalkHer get things done faster. \u201c Salesforce Essentials scales my time, and my ability to respond quickly and efficiently to clients.\u201d  |\n            \n                Founder & CEO, PepTalkHer \n            \n         \n                \n                    4.

But Palmer is convinced that if you\u2019re setting out to make real change, leaping isn\u2019t actually so hard. For her, that change is closing the gender gap.  Taking that leap produced a net for Palmer, and it created a support net for thousands of other women around the world fighting to have their real value recognized. In just a few years, PepTalkHer has already helped thousands of women track workplace wins and develop their negotiation muscles through its coaching methods, corporate events, and mobile app. The company website touts the story of a woman named Charlotte who used the app to help negotiate a whopping $87,000 raise. It all flows from there: Help individuals be bold in negotiations, work toward collective success for all women, and impact everyone\u2019s lives for the better. \u00a0 \u201c We have this belief that if women know their worth and know how to negotiate their worth, everyone will be better off.\u201d  |\n            \n                Founder & CEO, PepTalkHer \n            \n         \n

anxious about sending mass emails. As the team at\u00a0 Campaign Monitor \u00a0notes, email senders frequently worry about potential typos, whether their graphics will render properly, or whether they\u2019ve sent their emails to the wrong list entirely. Others fear that customers will see their emails as pesky rather than helpful. Done well, however, mass emails can generate interest in your business and keep you connected to customers. \n                \n                    Why Your Business Should Embrace Mass Emails \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             \n                \n                    Email feels right to your customers \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             Social media, direct messaging, and chatbots are all comparatively novel, but customers still prefer to have their commercial conversations from their inboxes. Research shows this happens across generations, too. Even for younger customers, email provides the more appropriate context for a marketing message, says\u00a0 Ryan Phelan , Fractional CMO at Origin Email. \u201cWhen it comes to their friends, [teens and young adults] need an immediate response because they\u2019re having a conversation,\u201d Phelan writes. \u201cBut when it comes to businesses, there\u2019s not the same immediacy so email is the appropriate medium.\u201d \n                \n                    Personalized experiences \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             Automated mass emails can help you touch base with customers precisely when they need your business\u2019s input. For example, say you are running an e-commerce shop, and you have been diligently tracking\u00a0 customer experience data . Your data reveals that shoppers have regularly placed one type of item\u2014perhaps a higher-ticket item\u2014in their shopping carts then never completed the transaction. You could send out a mass email to each of those customers with a reminder that the item\u2019s supply is limited, or you could even reach out with a discount code. Such relevance provides a sense of personalization that few other marketing tools can match. Personalized ads can\u2019t do this. Most social media users likely have experienced the frustration of seeing ads for a product they just purchased. Strategic emails, however, avoid this problem. A well-timed email shows you know what\u2019s on the customer\u2019s mind, and you\u2019re ready to step in and help them through a buying decision. \n                \n                    Ensure Your Emails Arrive in Customers\u2019 Inboxes \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             \n                \n                    Build a brand-new email list \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             Don\u2019t buy a list of email addresses someone in the past cobbled together. That old email list likely will be out of date, meaning much of your mailing becomes undeliverable or lands in a spam folder. Instead, start building a new list for mass emails. If you don\u2019t know where to start with email list-building, check out our guide to\u00a0 using your online presence to generate leads . Choose an email service provider who can grow with you You will need an email marketing service provider to actually send out mass emails. Many of these providers integrate with Salesforce Essentials. To find an email service provider that will grow with you: Consider your planned volume. You may not need to send emails to 250,000 customers today, but what about a year from now? Prioritize user-friendly interfaces and analytics. These will help you track and improve the performance of your campaigns over time. \n                \n                    Choose the right mass email format for the task at hand \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             Not all mass emails are identical, and different formats have different benefits. Email newsletters, for example, can help you reach many different readers with varying interests by diversifying the type of content as well as the topics covered. Newsletters, however, can be difficult to design to fit all screens, and they tend to dilute your call to action by burying it in excessive information. Dedicated marketing emails, by contrast, have a specific call to action and a simple layout. Further, they arrive periodically, not regularly, and can attract recipients\u2019 attention simply by being novel. \n                \n                    Be an Ethical Email Marketer \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             \n                \n                    Make it easy to opt-in (and out) \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             \n                \n                    Let the CAN-SPAM Act be your baseline for good business \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             The CAN-SPAM Act requires mass emails to clearly state: Your company\u2019s contact information The purpose of the email A link that allows users to manage the data you have on them A link that allows users to read the newsletter online These requirements aren\u2019t merely legal obligations; they\u2019re also good business practices. After all, on a normal day people see 5,000-plus advertisements, Hootsuite CEO\u00a0 Ryan Holmes \u00a0writes. Your message, no matter what it is, will be competing with thousands of other messages. Emails that quickly announce who the sender is, what their message is, and how to access recipient data stand a better chance of grabbing someone\u2019s precious few seconds of attention. \n                \n                    Ask for help if you need it \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             While the Federal Trade Commission provides information on CAN-SPAM Act compliance, the best way to be sure you\u2019re following the rules is to consult an attorney with experience in business email and Internet obligations. The right lawyer can also help you identify other laws that may apply to your online activities, like the European Union\u2019s GDPR, and chart a course for compliance. To get mass emails right: Personalize the experience, and make it opt-in Choose the right tech tools Tailor each message to the occasion, and analyze results for continual improvement Be mindful of your legal obligations The right mass email methods can boost business, build connections, and cement a small business as an essential part of its community.
